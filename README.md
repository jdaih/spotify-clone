## Issues 
- Netlify deployment can login a user but cannot connect to server afterwards
- All of the possible links are purely cosmetic





## Stretch Goals
1. Functional music player with ability to pause, skip, and rewind
2. Original functionality of Spotify (ex. Liking tracks) 
3. Functional search bar that can find songs, artists, etc.
